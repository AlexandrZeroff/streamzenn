## Project notes

Website was created for JMIND Systems Ltd, as a product page for their Streamzenn service.\
ReactJS was chosen because of its optimized, easy and fast operation. Also Tailwind CSS was used to speed up development and reduce the code size. Here`s full app code except some ENV variables (for security reasons).
